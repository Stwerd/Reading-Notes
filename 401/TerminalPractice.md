# Reading Notes

## The Command Line

* Fairly simple, opening and understanding how command lines work has been done so much these past months already that I feel very comfortable doing this.

## Basic Navigation

* I havent learnt much about navigation prior to this besides the simple use of cd and ..

* When I used to find my location I usually use ls to see the parents, I'll use pwd from now own.

* ~ Doesn't have much use to me, going all the way back to the home is so far from my files

## More About Files

* Ill keep to memory how to get spaces into my files, even though I think that its a bad habit to have spaces in files, its school that using quotes or \ works in naming as well

* I sort of knew they didn't require file names, as ive not named files with extensions before and the vscode knew what type of document it was anyway

## Manual Pages

* Again, some interesting tidbits to save, mostly I didn't know you could search inside you file system at all, and I like that its a option and will probably come in handy later with more files and working parts, but it could also be prevented with proper file management.

* man <command>
    Look up the manual page for a particular command.
* man -k <search term>
    Do a keyword search for all manual pages containing the given search term.
* /<term>
    Within a manual page, perform a search for 'term'
* n
    After performing a search within a manual page, select the next found item. 

## File Manipulation

Stuff to Save


mkdir
    Make Directory - ie. Create a directory.

rmdir
    Remove Directory - ie. Delete a directory.

touch
    Create a blank file.

cp
    Copy - ie. Copy a file or directory.

mv
    Move - ie. Move a file or directory (can also be used to rename).

rm
    Remove - ie. Delete a file.

* I probally will continue to use vscode to manipulate files, because for the most part its easier to rename and sort files this way, and there is some form of undo.
