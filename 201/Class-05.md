If you want to put a picture of your family on the wall youd want the picture of them to be a rectangle so the everyone in it looks normal right? That would be a gif.

   2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
   - I'd set the entire body to a easier color than just white, and give the title some more weight. Id make some smaller sections a diffrent background color and font color too. I would make sure to use a pallete generator so that it all flows and doesnt have a lot of contrast.
   3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
   - what the text body contains, what type of device the primary user base will be viewing the site on. How old the user base is and what the background color of the text is.
   4. What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?
   - The size of the text, the boldness of lack there of of the text, and if the text is normal, italicized or simulated italics.

   - You could do that by adding spacing with margins. You could also change the space between just the lines of text with line-height. Or if looking for more space between words use letter-spacing and word-spacing respectivly.
