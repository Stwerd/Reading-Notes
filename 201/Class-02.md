# Introduction to html
Html is like the frame of a ship, its not pretty to look at and while it techinally floats 
its not going anywhere, to make it look better and give it a purpose you need css and 
javascript, but without the frame to insert those things the css and javascript would 
fail to do anything as well.

# How CSS is Structured
  1. You can do apply css thru inline when you delcare a element, in the body where you refrence elements and then apply them or in css you refrence a css document in your html file that edits the elements there
  2. If you constantly do inline editing it can be hard to make changes later with all your edits all over your code. It also doesnt support some css functions.
   
    -H2 is the element being selected to be styled
    -The two styles being applied, the color and the padding size, are the css declarations
    -The black font and the 5px size are its properties
# Javascript Basics
  1.String
  
  2.Pemdas(math), Assignment, which assigns a value to a variable and  strict equality (===) which tests if two values are equal
  
  3.You could create a function that multiplies whatever two numbers you put into it.
  
# Makings Decisions in your code - Conditionals
  1.A condition you set runs as true, such as if var Number was set to 5 and checked to see if it was equal to 5, which if true would run the code within the if brackets
  
  2.It runs after the if statment beforhand returns false, then checks to see if the condionts in its ()'s are true, which if true will run the code in its {}. If false it will run the code in the else {}
  
  3.>, < , >=, <=, === and !==
  
  4.The && comparison operator only returns true if both conditions are true, while the || conditional operator returns false only if both conditionals are false.
