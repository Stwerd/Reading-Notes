What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

    Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
        Syntax means you did not spell the words correctly, or the code expects a semi-colon but did not recieve one. Logic errors are something like loops not closing, or code running in unexpected ways.
    List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
        I corrected an error where my code for salmon cookies displayed the data in a single long row on my chart, and still displayed the diffrent locations in diffrent rows. I fixed this by adding a appendChild tr in my for loop where I render each city.
    How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals? 
        I will continue to fix bugs for the rest of my coding career, understanding what errors mean what can help me quickly fix my bugs in my code.

The JavaScript Debugger.

    How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
        It would be used to help debug code by selecting code to run in small sections at a time, so that you can smoke out the errors efficiently.
    Define what a breakpoint is.
        Where you tell the debugger to stop running the code at.
    What is the call stack?
        It is where you code is currently pointing too.
