Video and Audio Content (Links to an external site.)

    Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
        In the early days of the internet, coders did not have the ability to embed audio of video files. When bandwidth was accessible and high enough to load videos, they first used flash, and the silver light to embed video and audio files.
    Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.
        src allows you to embed the video from the location of a file. Use the control attributes to edit the element so that you can pause and mute the audio or video.
    Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?
        Incase the audio does not load.
    Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.
        audio is cool, but video is extra cool, and that it because the video tag doesn't just play audio, and can also play music videos, embarrassing the audio tag. Audio tag then dies.

A Complete Guide To Grid (Links to an external site.)

    How does Grid layout differ from Flex?
        flex is one direction content, with overflow simply working until you reach a scenario where it doesnt work. While grid takes into account rows and columns at the same time.
    Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.
        Containters are the bodys of the grid, and grid items are the boxes in the grid that can have the text or images to be displayed however you'd like. Finally, grid lines are the spacers in the grid.

Responsive Images (Links to an external site.)

    Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?
        So that images don't waste bandwidth loading images that cant even be properly displayed on the screen.
    Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.
        srcset is a property that allows browsers to choose which image size they want to load. sizes shows the max width and the other information in the image.
    How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?
        Since it doesnt have to load an image and apply crazy edits to it after its loaded such as in css to fit the css page.
